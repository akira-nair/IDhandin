        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to practice following the iterative design process in solving a design problem. In
          this project,
          we worked with Aster, a startup that seeks to improve womenâ€™s health practices. Pregnant individuals face
          challenges in managing healthcare documentation for prenatal and postpartum care, leading to incomplete or
          delayed submissions to the provider. In this project, Aster seeks a cohesive, user-friendly digital solution
          to
          streamline this process and improve care efficiency. We collaborated with Aster to create a hi-fi prototype of
          a
          mobile app that establishes an easy-to-use interface for pregnant individuals to efficiently complete
          healthcare
          forms.

        <h2> Challenges/Takeaways </h2>
        <p>
          One aspect of the problem we found challenging is integrating several ideas for form completion into our solution. Our company had several ideas
          for how a user could complete forms, such as through audio, text, and button mediums, so it took time and consideration putting those pieces together in our lofi prototype. What we found helpful during the iterative design process is not hesitating with testing several ideas, even if we would not end up using all of them in our final prototype. Including many ideas during our lofi phase was helpful because we were able to receive specific feedback from the founders on which aspects of the interface were strong and which aspects were weak. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We also strengthened our Figma skills through this project. One of the founders of Aster even showed us some of her Figma prototypes and we were all very impressed by all the detailed formatting that Figma is capable of specifying.
