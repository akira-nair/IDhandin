        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to practice following the iterative design process in solving a design problem. In
          this project,
          we worked with Aster, a startup that seeks to improve women’s health practices. Pregnant individuals face
          challenges in managing healthcare documentation for prenatal and postpartum care, leading to incomplete or
          delayed submissions to the provider. In this project, Aster seeks a cohesive, user-friendly digital solution
          to
          streamline this process and improve care efficiency. We collaborated with Aster to create a hi-fi prototype of
          a
          mobile app that establishes an easy-to-use interface for pregnant individuals to efficiently complete
          healthcare
          forms.

        <h2> Takeaways  </h2>
        <p>
          Our client, Aster, highlighted several positive features and key takeaways from our final prototype. Fifi, the founder, expressed her appreciation for our swift adjustment following her initial feedback.

        </p>
        <h2> Features they will implement </h2>
        <p>
        <li> Aster Assitant: we integrated a chatbot named Aster Assistant, which allows users to interact via chat, calls, or voice messages to complete forms. Fifi remarked that we effectively made Aster feel like a "warm entity" and succeeded in humanizing the company </li>
        <li> Time-Left Feature: aims to display how much time a user has remaining, helping to alleviate feelings of overwhelm by showing limits on task duration. This had not been previously considered by the company!</li>
        <li> Scan Feature: scan feature targets both patients and healthcare providers, enabling them to scan existing forms and avoid redundant tasks.This had not been considered previously. </li>
        <li>Lock screen question completion  </li>
        <li> Simple and straightforward design </li>
        <li> Accessible color palette </li>

        <h2> Things to improve </h2>
        <p> 

          <li> The affirmations page, though in good faith, may be patrionising and waste user’s time.</li>
          <li> Restructuring the information architecture on the checklist page in order to prevent a user being overwhelmed </li>
          <li> Adding shared features for instance a shared signature or shared information across forms
          </li>
        </p>

        <h2> What did we learn? </h2>

        <p>This was our team’s first attempt at prototyping and thus our final deliverable was not up to par. We would like to improve our autolayering and information architecture to modify our design from medium-level fidelity to high fidelity. 
          We also recognised that design features should be out of the box! While we were hesitant to add the gamification feature initially we are glad we did because it helped us pivot to other unique ideas such as timers and scanning. We recognise not all unique features will be well-recieved but we were encouraged to think broad!
